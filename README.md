# Implementing multiple snapsends concurrently.
Efficiency will be increased by 500% assuming that we are sending snaps to 5 people at the same time.

# How to Run: 

```git clone -repo link here```
For the current codebase you have to provide the cordinates of each element from your android phone. You can go to setting open **"shop cordinates"** or **show taps**

Required Software: 
* python 3
* **ADB** android debug bridge installed
* An android device that you will connect to your pc. So we can execute the shell command through any charging cable. make sure that the charging cable supports data Transfer.

To send one snap at a time you can simple run the command

```python snapscore.py```

to multiple snaps to a group of people you can use the flag **"exp"**

``` python snapscore.py exp```


What can Be improved? 
* Instead of giving the cordinates, we can take screen shot of the android device, compare it with a smaller image where we want to click
* get the cordinates of that image.
* And automatically perform actions on those cordinates. this will be genius and unstopable but then everyone will have a higher snapscore and then it will not be fun and then this will loose it value which I don't want.ðŸ˜‰

* current snapscore reached : **1000480+**
* images sent : **782,644**
