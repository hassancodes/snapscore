# Implementing multiple snapsends concurrently.
Efficiency will be increased by 500% assuming that we are sending snaps to 5 people at the same time.

# How to Run: 

```git clone -repo link here```
For the current codebase you have to provide the cordinates of each element from your android phone. You can go to setting open **"shop cordinates"** or **show taps**

Required Software: 
* python 3
* **ADB** android debug bridge installed
* An android device that you will connect to your pc. So we can execute the shell command through any charging cable. make sure that the charging cable supports data Transfer.

To send one snap at a time you can simple run the command

```python snapscore.py```

to multiple snaps to a group of people you can use the flag **"exp"**

``` python snapscore.py exp```


What can Be improved? 
* Instead of giving the cordination, we can take screen shot of the android device, compare it with a smaller image where we want to click
* get the cordinates of that image.
* And automatically perform actions on those cordinates. this will be genius and unstopable but then everyone will have a higher snapscore and then it will not be fun and then this will loose it value which I don't want. I am thinking of making this a private repo lol ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.

Just kidding. 

* current snapscore reached : **1000480+**
* images sent : **782,644**
### Notes: 
"Still not getting banned on snapchat. So I will keep building snapscore"
- Idea : saw someone selling the snapscore to people . nice side hustle to make money
- comment : my repository is getting viral lol
- Someone just contacted me because they saw my repo. feeling like a caleb ðŸ˜‡
- I am thinking if this can be implemented on ios devices. that would be great
- lets see
- Lol 3 stars, less gooo
